# key-presser

08/01/2022:  
*F5_presser.py* uploaded. This program presses **F5** every 10 minutes. It can be used to maintain activity on web sessions and other timed events.

09/01/2022:  
README.md created.

10/01/2022:  
- First objective: try to use *tkinter* to make the presser's user interface.
- Second objectie: try to add options for the user.

14/01/2022:  
*F5_presser.py* upgraded with a new time format, it now includes **hour**.

15/01/2022:  
Minor issue detected: the clock is delaying a few seconds per hour.

20/01/2022:  
*time.sleep* adjusted to 0.95. Now, the clock is faster than the actual time.

21/01/2022:
I just read an article about *asyncio* library. Trying learn how to use it to see if it helps.
